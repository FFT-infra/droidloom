//! Denial-native wire contract for Droidloom task windows and presentation.
//!
//! This crate deliberately contains no Wayland types and performs no socket
//! syscalls. It defines and validates one packet per Unix `SOCK_SEQPACKET`
//! record. The platform adapters attach the descriptor roles returned by this
//! codec with `SCM_RIGHTS`, preserving descriptor ownership at that boundary.
